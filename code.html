# go.py
# This program will simulate a game of go (Wei Qi) on Python
# By: Jason Lu (jasonlu6@bu.edu)
# Date: 1/16/2017

# Modification: to allow choices for the user, we ask x and y coordinate from a range of 1-20,
# multiply each by 40, and ask the user for color selection (black or white)
# To prevent cheating: if the user chooses same color as previous,
# we will print out a "You LOSE the Game!", and the window will zoom out.
# The trick is to allow users to alternate colors until the game ends (when all the lines have
# been filled with either black or white pieces)

# Valentine's Day Skin (2/14/2017):
# Player 1: Red
# Player 2: Pink / Magenta
# Board: Blue

# You win the game by getting the most pieces on the board
# after all of the moves run out

# Tiebreaker: play a round by the lower level:
# Beginner: play with 10 moves only
# Intermediate: 20 moves
# Advanced: 50 moves

# Beginner: 20 moves (30 dan - 15 dan)
# Intermediate: 50 moves (15 dan - 7 dan)
# Advanced: 100 moves (7 dan - 1 dan)

# Capture: if any piece is surrounded by the other piece, as so:
# 1) Piece surrounded by cardinal directions with other color piece
# 2) Piece cornered in the corner by the other piece
# 3) Piece surrounded in a triangular fashion by other piece

# An area is called live, if all three conditions are met
# You can only take a live area after the next turn

# We will add a score accumulator as well, to count score
# In addition, we will add an "eye" for each quad-surrounded or triple-surrounded piece.
