# Personal-Webpage
It is finally here! 

After 1/4 of four score courses (~20) and six semesters later, I finally have my 
personal webpage for Boston University and beyond 

I have a home page, about me page, music (with some sweet Youtube jams) and other
fun things, all done in the name of computer science and tail recursion. 

Credit to Professor Aaron Stevens (from CS 108), Professor Snyder (CS 112)
and Professor Donham (CS 411) for teaching me the apps skills and the design
required to get my own webpage.
