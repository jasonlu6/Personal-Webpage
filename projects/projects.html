    <br>

    I used to play Go in my youth and it was an excellent board game, very similar to that of
    Checkers,
    except pieces can be captured or even taken away.

    You can play my version of the project by downloading <code>graphics.py</code> and
    <code>go.py</code>.
    Be sure that your Python interpreter is compatible with Python 3.5.

    Levels:

    <br>

    <button>Beginner (20 moves): 30-15 dan</button>

    <br>

    <button>Intermediate (50 moves): 15-7 dan</button>

    <br>

    My coding ability was born on May 23rd 2014, at Worcester Academy, during my capstone project
    before graduation.

    <br>

    I worked with Mrs. Wendy Cotta and Ms. McAvoy and the WA Sage Dining Services to build a
    functional website
    that will allow Worcester Academy students to be able to pick their own meals, and thus increase
    substainability
    considerably for the future.

    Does Amy choose Xaiver or does she choose Yancey or does she go for all three with Zeus? Jesus
    Franco (fellow BU
    CS student) and I investigate how do people find their matches using the Gale Shapley Algorithm
    for Stable Matching.
    We had fun with this project and it was a big time success for Valentine's Day for GAI Club and
    BU CS Facebook!

    <h3>General Project Description: </h3>

    <strong>Tagline:</strong>

    <p>
        employD, based on the Tinder and Bumble dating application design, is our semester long HCI
        project.
        This project is a way to bridge the gap between employers and job applicants during the job
        search
        process, by optimizing the job search experience with proven models. We hope that the
        process,
        at the end of the project, will result in a more effective and satisfying job search
        experience
        for everybody
    </p>

    <strong>Summary:</strong>

    <p>We use human-interaction models and Gestalt Principles and UI Design Principles to create
        an application to help enhance the job search experience for both job employers and
        applicants.</p>
